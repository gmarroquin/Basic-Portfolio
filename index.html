		<p1>
		"It's not time to worry yet" might be the most fitting quote to describe my personality. Also, coming from a country where "Worry Dolls" are a thing (Guatemala) - I strongly feel that finding solutions is a better way to spend my time and energy rather than worrying and panicking. 
		<br><br>
		I'm a responsible, self-motivated and critical thinking professional with 6+ years experience dealing with end users in the technology field. My experience ranges from sales, manufacturing, logistics, international travel, audits and application support. 
		<br><br>
		I am currently in the process acquiring the skillset of a Full Stack Developer.
		<br><br>
		Networking is a passion so please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you are interested in hearing about my travels (I've been to 12 countries in the past 4 years).
